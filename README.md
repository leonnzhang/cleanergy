# Cleanergy
This project was made for SET.Hacks() 2021 and was developed by @leonnzhang, @ToonyLoo and @Grogles. This project addresses Persona #2: Joe that deals with the issue of climate change.

Cleanergy is a web application that calculates the effectiveness and cost of certain energy sources based on factors inputted by the user.

This was the first hackathon project any of us have made, so we learned a lot about how to create something in a short amount of time.
